    <h1>Scottish Programming Languages Seminar</h1>
    <h1>Wednesday 9th March 2022</h1>
    <p>
      The <a href="../../../">Scottish Programming Languages Seminar
        (SPLS)</a> is an informal meeting for the discussion of any
        aspect of programming languages. This edition of SPLS will be
        hybrid, meaning it will be possible to attend this seminar
        either in-person or online. Physically, the seminar will be
        held at the Informatics Forum, The University of Edinburgh on
        Wednesday 9th March 2022. Lunch and coffee will be provided
        for the in-person attendees.
    </p>

    <p>

            <b>Launching the Scottish Programming Languages Institute</b>
            <p>
              We propose to set up a Scottish Programming Languages
              Institute (SPLI) as an umbrella for activities such as
              the Scottish Programming Languages Seminar (SPLS), the
              Scottish Summer School on Programming Languages and
              Verification (SPLV), various seminar series that have
              grown beyond their host institutions, and industrial
              engagement. By formally consolidating the breadth, depth
              and expertise of programming language research in
              Scotland, SPLI will provide a platform for future
              initiatives.

            <b>Automatic differentiation, in forward- and reverse-mode, as a one-liner</b>
            <p>
              This talk aims to demystify the basics of automatic
              differentiation (AD) by considering it as an abstract
              evaluator of symbolic expressions (the 'one-liner' of
              the title). We further show how to incorporate the
              mysteries of forward- and backward-mode AD by changing
              the result type of the evaluation in interesting, but
              algebraically comprehensible, ways, which moreover
              realise the successive improvements, in computational
              complexity, from purely functional vanilla forward-mode
              AD to imperative, array-based, reverse-mode AD.

            <b>Property-based container data types</b>
            <p>
              Container data types such as sets, lists, and trees,
              represent collections of data that, are commonly used in
              computer programs. Much work have been done in the past
              decades to design better abstraction, improve
              performance and verify correctness for container data
              types. However, one crucial problem still
              exists. Currently, when choosing a container data type,
              programmers can not choose an abstract container only
              based on the desired container’s behaviours, but they
              must choose a concrete implementation of that abstract
              container as well. For example, instead of being able to
              request a container with unique elements, programmers
              must choose between possible implementation such as
              trees or hash sets. One serious drawback is that the
              chosen concrete implementation cannot provide the
              desirable performance or memory efficiency in all usage
              scenarios. Also, the portability of programs is limited
              as one concrete implementation might only have optimised
              performance for certain hardware systems.

            <b>Idris Type-Driven Data Science</b>
            <p>
              Traditionally, most data science is done in dynamically
              typed languages. If you're manipulating a table of data,
              and make a typo in a column name, or ask for the wrong
              column, then you don't find out until runtime - after
              which significant computation may have taken place. So a
              small mistake could lose a large amount of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              With dependant types, we can express the schemas of
              tables at compile-time. This allows us to check, at
              compile-time, that our columns exist, and are of the
              correct types.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will go through a simple machine learning example,
              and show the whole workflow, to demonstrate how
              dependant types can help the process.

            <b>Descend: A safe GPU systems programming language</b>
            <p>
              Programming Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) is a
              challenging task even for expert programmers. Thousands
              of GPU threads have to be coordinated to safely make
              efficient use of the hardware resources. The most common
              GPU programming language CUDA, a variant of C, offers
              programmers great control over which thread operates at
              which time on which memory location. This is essential
              for achieving high performance but comes with the same
              memory and concurrency safety challenges well-known in
              C.  High-level languages such as Futhark or RISE address
              this by severely restricting the programmers' ability to
              control low-level details and providing fixed common
              higher level computational patterns, such as map and
              reduce.
            </p>
            <p>
              We present a new GPU programming language, Descend, that
              aims to combine the advantages of both approaches:
              enabling precise control safely.  Descend is heavily
              inspired by Rust, but addresses additional challenges
              arising from the GPU hardware. Descend 1) guarantees
              memory safety in the presence of thousands of parallel
              executing threads, 2) ensures the correct interaction
              between CPU and GPU, 3) enforces the GPU’s thread and
              memory hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this talk, I will present our current status of
              designing and implementing Descend, which includes a
              Rust-style affine type system with extended borrowing
              rules, and a prototype implementation of a compiler
              generating CUDA code. I will present Descend using
              examples to highlight how it enforces memory safety while
              allowing users to maintain control.

            <p>
              The Boehm-Demers-Weiser Garbage Collector (BDWGC) is a
              production-quality memory management framework for C/C++
              applications. In this talk, we explore adapting BDWGC
              for modern capability hardware, in particular the CHERI
              system, which provides guarantees about memory safety
              due to runtime enforcement of fine-grained pointer
              bounds and permissions. We describe various challenges
              presented by the CHERI micro-architectural constraints,
              along with some significant opportunities for runtime
              optimization.

    <h2><a name="attending" class="anchor">Attending</a></h2>

    <p>
    It is possible to attend the meeting in one of two ways: in-person
    or remotely via a video conferencing platform. In either case we
    ask that you <a href="#registration">register (see below)</a> such
    that we can allocate adequate resources to support both attendance
    modes.
    </p>

    <h3>Remote participation</h3>

    <p>
      The talks will be live streamed
      on <a href="https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/81180070031">Zoom</a> as
      well as on the <a href="https://youtu.be/YfWdHQ4DpQg">SPLS
      YouTube channel</a>. Both streams will go live before 13:00
      GMT. The details for the Zoom room are available on
      the <a href="https://spls.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/227707-spls">&#35;spls</a>

    <p>
      Remote attendees can ask questions to speakers live via Zoom by
      either using the raise hand feature or typing the question
      directly into the Zoom room chat or posting it on the topic
      stream on Zulip.
    </p>

    <h3>In-person participation</h3>
    <p>
      At the time of writing we are allowed a maximum of 50 in-person
      attendees. Every in-person attendee must follow the following
      rules.
      <ul>
        <li>Take at least one lateral flow test within 24 hours prior to
          the seminar, and only show up in person if the test result is
