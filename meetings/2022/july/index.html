            <h3>COVID-19</h3>
            <p>
                Following Scottish Government and University guidance, we ask participants displaying potential COVID-19 symptoms not to attend physically, and encourage participants to wear masks in indoor areas should they become busy. 
                The University supports the Distance Aware scheme, and can provide appropriate lanyards and badges.
            </p>
            <p>We strongly encourage participants to take a <strong>Lateral Flow Test (LFT)</strong> prior to the event; although the national testing programme has now finished, LFTs can be purchased from most major supermarkets and pharmacies.</p>
