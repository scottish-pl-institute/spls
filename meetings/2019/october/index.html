              otherwise. I'll look at the relationships between

              de-evolution from SIMULA to Smalltalk, Self, and
              Javascript. Finally I'll speculate about what it
              means when our programs don't just simulate the real
              world, but rise from the abyss replace it.</p>

              Model-View-Update (MVU) architecture for writing web
              applications in a functional style. Although popular
              amongst developers, MVU has not been studied
              formally; it is therefore difficult to reason about
              any extensions, and each implementer must re-discover
              the essence of the architecture.</p>
              <p>We introduce lambda-mvu, a formal description of
              the MVU architecture as a concurrent lambda-calculus,
              and prove its correctness. We modularly extend
              lambda-mvu with subscriptions and commands as found
              in the Elm programming language. We then further
              extend the calculus with linearity and model
              transitions, which are sufficient to allow us to
              provide the first formal integration of session-typed
              communication in a GUI framework. We implement our
              approach in the Links tierless web programming

              authentication workflow and multi-room chat

              <p>Multi-dimensional arrays play a major role in
              machine learning, numerical simulations or
              high-performance computing. Array programming in
              imperative languages involves explicit indexing
              within loop-nests which often leads to the code that
              is difficult to understand or reason about. APL
              offers a notation for array operations that is built
              around the notion of index-free combinators. APL
              programs are very concise yet carry very rich
              semantics. However, as APL is dynamically typed,
              reasoning about correctness of these programs is
              challenging.</p>
              <p>Designing a type system for APL is even more
              challenging. First, the same operator has different
              behavior depending on the type and shape of its
              arguments. Secondly, the shape of the result of an
              operator typically depends on the shape of its
              arguments. Finally, the type of array elements may
              change at runtime.</p>
              <p>In this talk I will describe preliminary results
              on formalising APL in Agda. I will present a shallow
              embedding of a core array language that makes it
              possible to define a set of APL operators and
              partially solve the overloading. As a result, a large
              set of APL programs can be translated into the
              proposed system. They can be then analysed for
              correctness or interpreted within Agda or compiled
              into executables.</p>

              <p>A common practice in dependently typed programming
              is <strong>correct-by-construction</strong>
              programming — where we write programs that carry
              statically a lot of the information that is needed to
              verify them. For example, instead of having
              <code>filter</code> take a list of <code>XS</code>
              and produce a list of <code>XS</code>, we declare a
              property <code>P</code> and return, as well as the
              list of <code>XS</code>, a proof for each
              <code>x</code> in the returned list that it satisfies
              <code>P</code>. However, when we do
              correct-by-construction programming with fancy types,
              we sometimes lose sight of how these functions
              compute. In this talk, I rectify a long-standing bug
              in the Agda and Idris standard libraries in their
              definitions of <code>Dec</code> — the type family
              that captures the decidability of a proposition — so
              as to get back good computational properties.</p>
