	      <p class="abstract">
		Energy, Time and Security (ETS) properties of
		programs are becoming increasingly prioritised by
		developers, especially where applications are
		running on ETS sensitive systems, such as embedded
		devices or the Internet of Things. Moreover,
		developers currently lack tools and language
		properties to allow them to reason about ETS. In
		this paper, we introduce a new contract
		specification framework, called Drive, which allows
		a developer to reason about ETS or other
		non-functional properties of their programs as
		first-class properties of the language. Furthermore,
		we introduce a contract specification language,
		allowing developers to reason about these
		first-class ETS properties by expressing contracts
		that are proved correct by an underlying formal type
		system. Finally, we show our contract framework over
		a number of representable examples, demonstrating
		provable worst-case ETS properties.

              <p class="abstract">
                Weak memory semantics studies modern hardware, such as
                ARMv8, which allow surprising behaviours.  In this
                talk, I will give a brief introduction to this area
                and explain the ongoing work in modelling the
                system-level aspects of the Arm architecture as used
                in operating system kernels, and JIT compilers,
                particularly those related to self-modifying code.  I
                will: show examples of weak behaviours for
                self-modifying code and instruction fetching; and give
                the current operational model that explains these
                behaviours.  This work is used by architects to
                rigorously analyse their architecture, OS kernel
                programmers to gain confidence in the architectural
                guarantees for the correctness of their code, and
                programming language implementors who wish to
                implement efficient just-in-time compilation.

	      <p class="abstract">
		It is well known that linear logic has semantics in
		symmetric monoidal closed categories, including the
		category of vector spaces and matrices.  We find
		that, aside from semantics, vectors and matrices are
		useful in the syntax too. I will present a calculus
		related to Atkey's Quantitative Type Theory where
		usage of variables can be constrained in various
		ways via annotations on variables in the context. We
		read a context's worth of annotations as a vector,
		and get that substitution involves matrix-vector
		multiplication. This leads to a clean statement and
		proof of the substitution lemma, where the data stay
		the same even as usage restrictions change in the
		typing derivation.

              <p class="abstract">
                Partial maps occur violently in the foundations of
                computer science, so we should be interested in how
                partiality works. Restriction categories capture
                partiality abstractly, but the resulting formalism can
                be difficult to work with. String diagrams are
                becoming widely used as a tool to simplify the
                presentation of tedious proofs in settings where they
                apply. In this talk I will present a series of happy
                coincidences of structure that allow us to reason
                about restriction categories with restriction products
                (and more) using string diagrams.

              <p class="abstract">
                The goal of probabilistic programming is to allow
                users to directly reason about their probabilistic
                models and processes generating data, while
                abstracting away the complicated algorithms needed to
                perform Bayesian inference. In practice, however,
                probabilistic programming languages are forced to
                trade off between generality of the language and
                efficiency of inference. For example, Stan &mdash; a
                popular probabilistic programming language &mdash;
                sacrifices discrete model parameters support, in
                exchange for efficient, gradient-based inference.<br /><br />

                However, there exist work-around methods for inference
                with discrete parameters, as described by Stan's
                language manual. A knowledgeable and experienced user
                can manually encode discrete parameters into the
                program, by marginalising them out of the target
                probability density. In this work-in-progress talk, I
                will explain in more detail how this is achieved, and
                talk about possible ways of automating this process
                using program transformations.

	      <p class="abstract">
		Agda's standard library struggles in various places
		with n-ary functions and relations. It introduces congruence and
		substitution operators for functions of arities one and two, and
		provides users with convenient combinators for manipulating indexed
		families of arity exactly one.<br /><br />

		After a careful analysis of the kinds of problems
		the unifier can easily solve, we design a
		unifier-friendly representation of n-ary functions.
		This allows us to write generic programs acting on
		n-ary functions which automatically reconstruct the
		representation of their inputs' types by
		unification. In particular, we can define fully
		level polymorphic n-ary versions of congruence,
		substitution and the combinators for indexed
		families, all requiring minimal user input.
