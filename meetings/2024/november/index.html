            </header>
            <p>
              The SPLS series is an informal meeting of the <a href="https://spli.scot">Scottish Programming Languages Institute (SPLI)</a> Community for discussing anything related to programming languages.</br></br>
              This edition (the 20th anniversary edition of SPLS!) will be held and organised by the the School of Computing Science at the <strong>University of Glasgow</strong> on the <strong>6th November 2024</strong>.
              The seminar will be held as a hybrid event, supporting both in-person and remote participation.
            </p>

              <!-- If you plan to attend in person, please register by <strong>Friday, 25<sup>th</sup> October 2024</strong> so that we have numbers for catering. -->

                The definition of substitution in the presence of lambda binding is notoriously difficult to get correct.
                The best technique, which I first learned from Conor McBride, is straightforward but does everything twice, defining renaming first and substitution second.
                That is not so bad, but the key result describing composition  explodes into four proofs, with either renaming or substitution on both the left and right.
                This talk describes a new approach that collapses the two definitions to one definition and the four proofs to one proof.
                The result includes a set of rewrites (taken from Autosubst) that can simplify any equation involving substitution.
                Our work is available as an Agda script.

                Cardano is a Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency with a market cap in the tens of billions of USD and a daily volume of hundreds of millions of USD.
                In this paper we reflect on applying formal methods, functional architecture and Haskell to building Cardano.
                We describe our strategy, our projects, reflect on lessons learned, the challenges we face and how we propose to meet them.

                A partial evaluator extends an interpreter to work on terms with free variables.
                In this talk, I will formalise this intuition for pure simply-typed languages.
                I will focus on the simply-typed lambda calculus, but my definitions are in terms of any second-order algebra as defined by Fiore.
                After giving a definition for a denotational interpreter, I will define what it means for a model of a language (formulated as a SOAS algebra) to extend an interpreter, as well as morphisms between extensions.
                From this, I will define the free extension of an interpreter, which is the least opinionated partial evaluator.

                Custom hardware architectures for functional languages enjoyed a boom in the 80s and 90s following Backus' Turing Award lecture "Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs".
                Research interest later waned due to difficulties in matching the rapid pace of RISC processor development and compiler techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                This talk from the HAFLANG project re-explores these ideas in a modern landscape --- where single-thread performance of stock CPUs have begun to stagnate, but the performance of hardware prototyping platforms such as FPGAs have not.
                We present the Heron processor for evaluating non-strict functional programs, as well as its concurrent hardware garbage collector. 
                While still slightly slower than conventional platforms, it offers interesting advantages in energy efficiency and opportunity for formal verification from source language down to hardware implementation.
                We also propose a path towards a single-chip many-core architecture.

                Classical Processes is a process calculus interpretation of Classical Linear Logic.
                Nominally, CP interprets CLL's axiom as a <em>forwarder</em> process, which sends any message it receives over its input channel over its output channel.
                Operationally, CP's forwarders do not forward messages at all.
                Instead, they put their input and output channels together and terminate.
                This causes lots of trouble with CP's metatheory and its use as a model of concurrent computation.
              </p>
              <p>
                I propose an alternative operational semantics for forwarders which avoids this trouble and has an pleasant interpretation in CLL.

                When reasoning about inductively defined predicates over syntax with bindings, keeping bound variables fresh helps to reduce the complexity of the proofs.
                We have identified a general criteria when it is possible to strengthen the induction theorem derived from the knaster-tarski fixpoint underlying the inductive predicate to avoid bound variables.
                This criteria is not dependent on the syntactic format of the rules, and thus supports e.g. higher order relators and quantifiers in the predicate without requiring extra side conditions.

                This talk is about a side project I did on compiling Fortran to Uxn, a tiny stack-based VM with 64 kB memory and 8-bit instructions.
                The talk focuses on two languages: Fortran (naturally) and Funktal, a strict, statically typed functional language for Uxn; and on their compilers: a general purpose, "serious" source-to-source compiler for Fortran, and a custom, "frivolous" compiler from Funktal.
                The link between the two will become clear in the talk.
