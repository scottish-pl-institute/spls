This edition of SPLS will be hybrid and is organised by the
[MSP Group](https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk)
of the Department of Computer & Information Sciences at
[University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk).

SPLS will take place at the
[University of Strathclyde campus](https://www.strath.ac.uk/maps/)
in central Glasgow.
Talks will take place in room **TL325** in the *Learning and Teaching Building*
([49 Richmond Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bReUXWTAfPWAdSSf6)).
There will be signs directing you from the **main** entrance of the building.

Accessibility information is [available here](https://www.accessable.co.uk/university-of-strathclyde-glasgow/).

We also plan to stream SPLS, using **tbc**.

A special PhD event will be held in the morning, starting at 1000hrs.
The PhD Event will be held in **LT1414a** in *Livingstone Tower*,
home to the Department of Computer & Information Sciences.
It will be an introduction to SPLI in specific,
and doing a PhD in general,
as well as a chance to meet your fellow PhD students from other institutes.
It is intended to be most useful to students early in their PhD, although everyone is free to attend (including non-PhD students). We would strongly recommend in-person attendance at the PhD event, but if you wish to attend it remotely, please contact us via email.
