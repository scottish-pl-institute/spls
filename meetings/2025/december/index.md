# Scottish Programming Languages Seminar

## Wednesday, 03 December 2025

The
[Scottish Programming Languages Seminar (SPLS)](https://scottish-pl-institute.github.io/spls)
Series is an informal meeting of the
[Scottish Programming Languages Institute (SPLI)](https://scottish-pl-institute.github.io/)
Community for discussing anything related to programming languages.

We kindly acknowledge the continuing sponsorship of the [Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA)](https://sicsa.ac.uk).


This edition of SPLS will be hybrid and is organised by the
[MSP Group](https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk)
of the Department of Computer & Information Sciences at
[University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk).

SPLS will take place at the
[University of Strathclyde campus](https://www.strath.ac.uk/maps/)
in central Glasgow.
Talks will take place in room **TL325** in the *Learning and Teaching Building*
([49 Richmond Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bReUXWTAfPWAdSSf6)).
There will be signs directing you from the **main** entrance of the building.

Prior to the main programme there will be a catered lunch provided in room **TL328**,
also in the *Learning and Teaching Building* and opposite where SPLS will take place.

Accessibility information for the University of Strathclyde is [available here](https://www.accessable.co.uk/university-of-strathclyde-glasgow/).

We also plan to stream SPLS, using **tbc**.

A special PhD event will be held in the morning, starting at 1000hrs.
The PhD Event will be held in **LT1414a** in *Livingstone Tower*,
home to the Department of Computer & Information Sciences.
It will be an introduction to SPLI,
and doing a PhD in general,
as well as a chance to meet your fellow PhD students from other SPLI institutes.
Although everyone is free to attend the PhD event
(including non-PhD students),
the event is primarily aimed for students early in their PhD.
We would strongly recommend in-person attendance at the PhD event,
however, if you wish to attend it remotely then please contact us via email.

Residualizing Functors using Neighborhood Semantics
</span>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Normalization by Evaluation (NbE) is an algorithmic technique
for normalizing terms in a calculus by interpreting them in a
suitable denotational model of the calculus. A model employed
for this purpose allows normal forms to be reconstructed from
the denotation of a term, and is known as a residualizing
model. While NbE has been shown to be a versatile technique,
constructing a residualizing model requires ingenuity and is
often achieved using ad hoc calculus-specific methods that
lack extensibility and reusability. In this talk, I will
present ongoing work to develop a modal framework based on
neighborhood semantics to construct residualizing models of
various functors in typed lambda calculi. The proposed
framework offers a systematic and lightweight alternative to
constructing residualizing models of functors directly and
makes it possible to isolate and reuse recurring patterns in
NbE algorithms. I will show how NbE algorithms (some new) can
be implemented and verified correct in Agda using this
framework.

Secure Scripting with CHERIoT MicroPython
</span>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
The lean MicroPython runtime is a widely adopted highlevel
programming framework for embedded microcontroller
systems. However, the existing MicroPython codebase has
limited security features, rendering it a fundamentally
insecure runtime environment. This is a critical problem,
given the growing deployment of highly interconnected IoT
systems on which society depends. Malicious actors seek to
compromise such embedded infrastructure, using sophisticated
attack vectors. We have implemented a novel variant of
MicroPython, adding support for runtime security features
provided in the CHERI RISC-V architecture as instantiated by
the CHERIoT-RTOS system. Our new MicroPython port supports
hardware-enabled spatial memory safety, mitigating a large set
of common runtime memory attacks. We have also
compartmentalized the MicroPython runtime, to prevent
untrusted code from elevating its permissions and taking
control of the entire system. We perform a multi-faceted
evaluation of our work, involving a qualitative
security-focused case study and a quantitative performance
analysis. The case study explores the full set of five
publicly reported MicroPython vulnerabilities (CVEs). We
demonstrate that the enhanced security provided by CHERIoT
MicroPython mitigate two heap buffer overflow CVEs. Our
performance analysis shows a geometric mean runtime overhead
of 48% for secure execution across a set of ten standard
Python benchmarks, although we argue this is indicative of
worst-case overhead on our prototype platform and a realistic
deployment overhead would be significantly lower. This work
opens up a new, secure-by-design approach to IoT application
development.

Denotational semantics for stabiliser quantum programs
</span>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
The stabiliser fragment of quantum theory is a foundational
building block for quantum error correction and the
fault-tolerant compilation of quantum programs. In this talk,
I will develop a sound, universal and complete denotational
semantics for stabiliser operations which include measurement,
classically-controlled Pauli operators, and affine classical
operations, in which quantum error-correcting codes are
first-class objects. The operations will be interpreted as
certain affine relations over finite fields. This offers a
conceptually motivated and computationally tractable
alternative to the standard operator-algebraic semantics of
quantum programs (whose time complexity grows exponentially as
the state space increases in size).

I will carefully introduce and motivate the stabiliser
fragment, before demonstrating the resulting semantics by
describing a small, proof-of-concept assembly language for
stabiliser programs with fully-abstract denotational
semantics.

Quantum circuits are just a phase
</span>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Quantum programs today are written at a low level of
abstraction---quantum circuits akin to assembly
languages---and the unitary parts of even advanced quantum
programming languages essentially function as circuit
description languages. This state of affairs impedes
scalability, clarity, and support for higher-level
reasoning. More abstract and expressive quantum programming
constructs are needed.

To this end, we introduce a simple syntax for generating
unitaries from 'just a phase'; we combine a (global) phase
operation that captures phase shifts with a quantum analogue
of the `if let`construct that captures subspace selection
via pattern matching. This minimal language lifts the focus
from gates to eigen-decomposition, conjugation, and controlled
unitaries; common building blocks in quantum algorithm design.

We demonstrate several aspects of the expressive power of our
language in several ways. Firstly, we establish that our
representation is universal by deriving a universal quantum
gate set. Secondly, we show that important quantum algorithms
can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's
search algorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier
Transform, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Quantum
Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give clean
denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum
mechanics. Finally, we implement a prototype compiler that
efficiently translates terms of our language to quantum
circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to these
semantics. Collectively, these contributions show that this
construct offers a principled and practical step toward more
abstract and structured quantum programming.

Natural models for computational irrelevance
</span>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Dependently typed programming languages benefit greatly from
the ability to mark certain data as irrelevant for the
purposes of runtime execution. There are many approaches to
such systems, but the most popular is quantitative type theory
(QTT), implemented by Agda and Idris2. In a simple
instantiation of QTT with the {0,ω} semiring and a subusaging
rule, we recover a version of MLTT with irrelevance. However,
metatheoretically, this is not so nice to work with---it is
not defined ‘algebraically’ in the way MLTT can be, and thus
is not immediately equipped any models, or initiality of the
syntax. As a result it is harder to show useful metatheorems
like canonicity or normalisation.

In this talk, I will present a different approach to
computational irrelevance that can be described very concisely
by a second-order generalised algebraic theory
(SOGAT). Irrelevance is encoded as a phase distinction in the
form of a 'proposition' that can appear in a context. As a
bonus, the entire irrelevant fragment of the theory is
derivable rather than primitive. By general theorems of
SOGATs, this theory automatically comes with a rich category
of models, among which the syntax is initial. Other models
include a 'code extraction' model, as well as MLTT
itself. Metatheorems are achievable using modern gluing
techniques.

Practical Refinement Session Type Inference
</span>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Session types express and enforce safe communication in
concurrent message-passing systems by statically capturing the
interaction protocols between processes in the type. Recent
works extend session types with arithmetic refinements, which
enable additional fine-grained description of communication,
but impose additional annotation burden on the programmer. To
alleviate this burden, we propose a type inference algorithm
for a session type system with arithmetic refinements. We
develop a theory of subtyping for session types, including an
algorithm which we prove sound with respect to a semantic
definition based on type simulation. We also provide a formal
inference algorithm that generates type and arithmetic
constraints, which are then solved using the z3 SMT
solver. The algorithm has been implemented on top of the Rast
language, and includes 3 key optimizations that make inference
feasible and practical. We evaluate the efficacy of our
inference engine by evaluating it on 6 challenging benchmarks,
ranging from unary and binary natural numbers to linear
lambda-calculus. We show the performance benefits provided by
our optimizations in coercing z3 into solving the arithmetic
constraints in reasonable time.
