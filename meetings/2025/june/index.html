              We adapt Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi‚Äôs treatment of
              abstract syntax with binding, substitution, and holes to
              account for languages with second-class sorts. These
              situations include programming calculi such as the
              Call-by-Value ùúÜ-calculus (CBV) and Levy‚Äôs
              Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV). Prohibiting second-class
              sorts from appearing in variable contexts means the
              presheaf of variables is no longer a left-unit for Fiore
              et al‚Äôs substitution tensor product. We generalise their
              development to accommodate second-class sorts, and reuse
              much of the development through bicategorical
              arguments. We apply the resulting theory by proving
              substitution lemmata for varieties of CBV modularly.

              This talk is an extended practice talk for TYPES 2025
              where I am reporting on work-in-progress that uses
              techniques inspired by constructive negation to reframe
              decision procedures as pairings of positive datatypes
              that cancel each other out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specifically, I will report my experiences in providing
              a library of positive decision procedures, and using
              these procedures when programming. I will also examine
              how being so positive in one‚Äôs negativity can be
              backported to report our decision procedure's negativity
              more positively.

              Gradual typing provides a model for when a legacy
              language with less precise types interacts with a newer
              language with more precise types. Casts mediate between
              types of different precision, allocating blame when a
              value fails to conform to a type. The blame theorem
              asserts that blame always falls on the less-precisely
              typed side of a cast. One instance of interest is when a
              legacy language (such as Java) permits null values at
              every type, while a newer language (such as Scala or
              Kotlin) explicitly indicates which types permit null
              values. Nieto et al. in 2020 introduced a gradually
              typed calculus for just this purpose. The calculus
              requires three distinct constructors for function types
              and a non-standard proof of the blame theorem; it can
              embed terms from the legacy language into the newer
              language (or vice versa) only when they are
              closed. Here, we define a simpler calculus that is more
              orthogonal, with one constructor for function types and
              one for possibly nullable types, and with an entirely
              standard proof of the blame theorem; it can embed terms
              from the legacy language into the newer language (and
              vice versa) even if they are open. All results in the
              paper have been mechanized in Coq.

              In addition to technical details, the talk will ponder a
              sociological question: why was Nieto et al 2020 was
              published in ECOOP, while our simpler solution was
              rejected from ESOP and went "straight to video" in JFP?

              Actor languages such as Erlang and Elixir are widely
              used for implementing scalable and reliable distributed
              applications, but the informally-specified nature of
              actor communication patterns leaves systems vulnerable
              to costly errors such as communication mismatches and
              deadlocks. Multiparty session types (MPSTs) rule out
              communication errors early in the development process,
              but until now, the nature of actor communication has
              made it difficult for actor languages to benefit from
              session types.
            </p>
            <p>
              This paper introduces Maty, the first actor language
              design supporting both static multiparty session typing
              and the full power of actors taking part in multiple
              sessions. Our main insight is to enforce session typing
              through a flow-sensitive type-and-effect system,
              combined with an event-driven programming style and
              first-class message handlers. Using MPSTs allows us to
              guarantee communication safety: a process will never
              send or receive an unexpected message, nor will it ever
              get stuck waiting for a message that will never
              arrive. We extend Maty to support both Erlang-style
              cascading failure handling and the ability to
              proactively switch between sessions. We implement Maty
              in Scala using an API generation approach, and evaluate
              our implementation on a series of microbenchmarks, a
              factory scenario, and a chat server.

              Concurrent programs destructively updating shared memory
              are notoriously hard to get right. Concurrent separation
              logics are logics with built-in notions of
              e.g. ownership of memory regions, concurrent accesses,
              and lock mechanisms. They give experts a way to verify a
              posteriori that complex concurrent imperative programs
              hopefully abide by their formal specification.  We will
              see how next generation languages let us get rid of a
              posteriori verification in favour of a
              correct-by-construction approach whereby the program is
              interactively built in a specification-respecting
              dialogue with the compiler.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this presentation we will be using Idris 2, a
              general purpose functional language with an expressive
              type system combining dependent types to enforce complex
              invariants and linear logic to track resource usage.  We
              will demonstrate how a simple library can capture ideas
              from concurrent separation logic by providing
              proof-carrying concurrent primitives. These make it
              impossible to write into memory one does not own or to
              release a lock without having proven that its associated
              invariant has been re-established. They also guarantee
              that whatever is read from the shared memory is
              invariant-respecting.  This will culminate in worked out
              example e.g. the definition of map-reduce primitives
              repeatedly and safely breaking down a buffer into chunks
              that can be processed concurrently.

              This talk summarizes recent work aiming at developing
              real-valued logics appropriate for reasoning about
              algebraic structures on metric spaces and as support for
              metatheoretical reasoning for approximated mathematical
              (exact) phenomena. The main application is generalizing
              the theory of Quantitative Algebras and Quantitative
              Equational Logics, but they also open the perspective of
              developing mathematical theories where identity is not
              the main metalogical predicate.

              <em>Neuro-symbolic code</em> simply refers to any
              (standard, symbolic) program in which some exact
              calculations are replaced by approximations given by
              neural networks or similar machine-learning algorithms.
              The purpose of <em>proof-carrying neuro-symbolic
              code</em> as a research direction is to propose
              languages or programming environments where
              implementation of such a system, as well as all
              necessary proofs of its safety, can be carried out in a
              sound and consistent way. This has proven to be a
              (programming language) challenge.  However, some battles
              have been won. This talk will explain the existing
              challenges and the future directions.
