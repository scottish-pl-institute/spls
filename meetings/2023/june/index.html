<p>
In the standard algebraic approach to effects, once an operation
is called, the evaluation of the continuation stalls until it gets a result
(either from a built-in primitive effect or through a handler). But we often
desire asynchronous behaviour, when the continuation may proceed with the
evaluation and suitably incorporates the result once it arrives. I will
describe a small calculus with primitives for sending such signals and
receiving corresponding interrupts, and show a small prototype in which one can
express promises, preemptive multi-threading and remote function calls.

<p>
A distributed system is permissionless when participants can join and leave the
network without permission from a central authority. Many modern distributed
systems are naturally permissionless, in the sense that a central permissioning
authority would defeat their design purpose: this includes blockchains,
filesharing protocols, some voting systems, and more. By their permissionless
nature, such systems are heterogeneous: participants may only have a partial
view of the system, and they may also have different goals and beliefs. Thus,
the traditional notion of consensus -- i.e. system-wide agreement -- may not be
adequate, and we may need to generalise it.
</p>

<p>
This is a challenge: how should we understand what heterogeneous consensus is;
what mathematical framework might this require; and how can we use this to
build understanding and mathematical models of robust, effective, and secure
permissionless systems in practice?
</p>

<p>
We analyse heterogeneous consensus using semitopology as a framework. This is
like topology, but without the restriction that intersections of opens be open.
Semitopologies have a rich theory which is related to topology, but with its
own distinct character and mathematics. We introduce novel well-behavedness
conditions, including an anti-Hausdorff property and a new notion of `topen
set', and we show how these structures relate to consensus. We give a
restriction of semitopologies to witness semitopologies, which are an
algorithmically tractable subclass corresponding to Horn clause theories,
having particularly good mathematical properties. We introduce and study
several other basic notions that are specific and novel to semitopologies, and
study how known quantities in topology, such as dense subsets and closures,
display interesting and useful new behaviour in this new semitopological
context.

<p>
Strategic rewriting languages provide programmers with combinators and generic
traversals that allow them to compose rewrite rules and control their
application. Strategic rewriting has applications in many domains, including
interpreter/compiler for DSLs (Spoofax/Stratego) and program optimisation
(ELEVATE). It is important to reason about strategies, to ensure that they are
well-composed (do not result in error), do not diverge and indeed rewrites
expressions into forms that satisfy desired properties. To formally understand
strategies, we formalise a denotational semantics of the strategy rewriting
language System S and demonstrates its correspondence to existing big-step
operational semantics. To facilitate formal reasoning over strategies, we
formalise the weakest precondition calculus for System S, and demonstrate that
it can be used to reason about whether or not a strategy terminates and is
well-composed as well as the execution of a strategy leads to the result that
satisfies desired properties.

<p>
Ordinals are useful for justifying termination, and giving semantics to
inductive definitions, but should one use set theory or type theory to develop
the theory of ordinals? In constructive set theory, an ordinal is usually
understood as a hereditarily transitive set, whereas in homotopy type theory,
an ordinal is a type with a transitive, wellfounded, and extensional binary
relation -- two seemingly quite different approaches! However, we show that
they are actually the same, in the following sense: working in homotopy type
theory, we can use (a higher-inductive refinement of) Aczel's interpretation of
constructive set theory into type theory to construct a type of set-theoretic
ordinals. We show that this type is equal to the type of type-theoretic
ordinals. Going further, we also show how the notion of a type-theoretic
ordinal can be generalised to a natural class of ordered structures, which
captures all sets in Aczel's interpretation.

To any functional programmer, it is intuitively obvious that call-by-name
evaluation can simulate the call-by-value one. However, most proofs of this
fact are rather complex, or follow as corollaries from significantly more
involved theorems. In this talk I will demonstrate a simple approach to proving
this simulation result, with some methodological takeaways.

          Picking a CHERI Allocator: Security and Performance Considerations

Several open-source memory allocators have been ported to CHERI, a hardware
capability platform. In this presentation we examine the security and
performance of these allocators when run under CheriBSD on Arm’s prototype
Morello platform. We introduce a number of security attacks and show that all
but one allocator are vulnerable to some of the attacks - including the default
CheriBSD allocator. We then show that while some forms of allocator performance
are meaningful, comparing the performance of hybrid and pure capability (i.e.
‘running in non-CHERI vs. running in CHERI modes’) allocators does not
currently appear to be meaningful. Although we do not fully understand the
reasons for this, it seems to be at least as much due to factors such as
immature compiler toolchains and prototype hardware as it is due to the effects
of capabilities on performance.
