        Session types statically guarantee that concurrent communication  complies with a protocol. We give the first formal account of session typing with exception handling in a functional programming language. We define a core calculus which satisfies preservation and progress properties, is deadlock free, data-race free, and terminating. We provide the first implementation of session typing with exception handling for a fully fledged functional programming language, by extending the Links web programming language. Our implementation draws on existing work on algebraic effects and effect handlers. We illustrate our implementation through a chat server application for the web, in which all communication occurs over session typed channels and disconnections are handled gracefully.

The π-calculus, viewed as a core concurrent programming language, has
been used as the target of much research on type systems for
concurrency. We propose a new type system for deadlock-free session-
typed π-calculus processes, by integrating two separate lines of
work. The first is the propositions-as-types approach by Caires and
Pfenning, which provides a linear logic foundation for session types
and guarantees deadlock-freedom by forbidding cyclic process
connections. The second is Kobayashi’s approach in which types are
annotated with priorities so that the type system can check whether
or not processes contain genuine cyclic dependencies between
communication operations. We combine these two techniques for the
first time, and define a new and more expressive variant of classical
linear logic with a proof assignment that gives a session type system
with Kobayashi-style priorities. This can be seen in three ways: (i)
as a new linear logic in which cyclic structures can be derived and a
cycle-elimination theorem generalises cut-elimination; (ii) as a
logically- based session type system, which is more expressive than
Caires and Pfenning’s; (iii) as a logical foundation for Kobayashi’s
system, bringing it into the sphere of the propositions-as-types
paradigm.</p></td>

          <p>Stencil computations are widely used from physical simulations to
 machine-learning. They are embarrassingly parallel and are commonly
 executed on modern parallel systems such as multi-core CPUs, Graphic
 Processing Units (GPUs). Although stencil computations have been
 extensively studied, optimizing them for increasingly diverse and
 ever-changing hardware remains challenging even for performance
 experts. Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) have raised the programming
 abstraction and offer good performance. However, this abstraction
 places the burden of optimizing stencil codes for the targeted
 architectures on DSL implementers who have to write full-fledged
 parallelizing compilers and optimizers for every architecture.
          </p>
<p> Lift has recently emerged as a promising approach to achieve
 performance portability. It is based on a small set of reusable
 parallel primitives that DSL writers can build upon. Lift’s key
 novelty is in its encoding of optimizations as a system of extensible
 rewrite rules which are used to explore the optimisation. So far,
 Lift has focused on linear algebra operations and it it is an open
 question if this approach is applicable for other domains.
</p>
<p> In this talk, I demonstrate how complex multidimensional stencil
 codes and optimizations such as tiling are expressible using
 compositions of simple 1D Lift primitives. This allows us to build an
 elegant optimizing compiler using rewriting without requiring
 specialized domain- or architecture-specific solutions. By leveraging
 existing Lift primitives and optimizations, we only require the
 addition of two primitives and one rewrite rule to do s\o. Our results
 show that this approach outperforms existing compiler approaches and
            hand-tuned codes.</p>

        High-performance computing is turning towards heterogeneous solutions in the search for performance and power-efficiency. Building compute nodes with multi-core CPUs, GPUs and
especially FPGAs allows for a large degree of configurability. However this brings with it the challenge of finding the optimum configuration. 
The TyTra compiler seeks to optimise streaming dataflow applications, on heterogeneous platforms, with the help of type transformations and an accurate cost/performance model.
From a source program, TyTra generates multiple program variants, costs them and selects the best performing variant.
This work looks at ways to optimise program variant generation and selection in TyTra. We do this by leveraging the structure of the applications considered as well as constraints imposed by the target hardware architecture. We present our approach to an optimal program variant selection algorithm that relies on pruning to meet resource constraints.

        The scaling of multi-core processors poses a challenge to memory                   
system design.  Increased cores generate more accesses to shared                   
caches causing conflict misses as unrelated processes compete for the              
same cache sets.  Each miss represents significant waste: wasted time              
as the requested data is transferred from a slow main memory, wasted               
energy and bandwidth when transferring cache block words that will                 
ultimately go unused.  In this talk I will explore the means to                    
leverage memory reference speculation to reduce waste and improve                  
efficiency in multi-core processor memory systems.  In particular, we              
will examine memory reference speculation in the context of holistic               
cache management, merging data prefetching and replacement policy.  I              
will outline a novel confidence path-based prefetching scheme, the                 
Signature Path Prefetcher (SPP).  SPP uses a compressed history based              
signature that accurately predicts complex address patterns, allowing
the prefetcher to run far ahead of the current demand stream.  SPP
uses a dynamically constructed path confidence in its prediction to
adaptively throttle itself on a per-prefetch stream basis.  Unlike
other algorithms, SPP tracks complex patterns across physical page
boundaries and continues prefetching as soon as they move to new
pages.  Memory reference speculation can be leveraged far beyond data
prefetching. In particular, the path confidence developed in SPP
represents a proxy of use distance for future memory access, providing
new possibilities to integrate memory management techniques at
different levels of cache.  In the second half of my talk I will
outline how the path confidence derived from the SPP prefetcher can be
used as a direct representation of reuse distance to inform
replacement policy as well as cache-level placement in the larger
cache hierarchy.  Finally, I will discuss how similar mechanisms can
be used for page placement, prefetching and replacement in systems
incorporating emerging non-volatile memory technologies.

      </tr>
      <tr><td class="abstract" colspan="3">
          <p>Optimizing compilers require sophisticated program analysis and transformations to exploit modern hardware. Implementing the appropriate analysis for a compiler optimization is a time consuming activity. For example, in LLVM, tens of thousands of lines of code are required to detect appropriate places to apply peephole optimizations. It is a barrier to the rapid prototyping and evaluation of new optimizations. In this paper we present the Compiler Analysis Description Language (CAnDL), a domain specific language for compiler analysis. CAnDL is a constraint based language that operates over LLVM's intermediate representation. The compiler developer writes a CAnDL program, which is then compiled by the CAnDL compiler into a C++ LLVM pass. It provides a uniform manner in which to describe compiler analysis and can be applied to a range of compiler analysis problems, reducing code length and complexity. We implemented and evaluated CAnDL on a number of real world use cases: eliminating redundant operations; graphics code optimization; identifying static control flow regions. In all cases were we able to express the analysis more briefly than competing approaches. </p>

          <p>Understanding and controlling software energy usage is an increasing concern in many settings. To date, there has been little work, however, on understanding how energy relates to high level programming constructs, or on dealing with real parallel systems, especially at a significant scale. We measure and correlate the energy usage of several parallel Haskell programs against execution time and other runtime system (RTS) metrics, produced using the standard Haskell compiler, GHC. We show how energy usage relates to the number of cores, giving performance results on a recent Intel Xeon x86 system that has 28 physical cores and supports hyperthreading. From these results, we construct an energy model and relate this model to the metrics of the program in parallel execution. Given a suitable structural model of parallelism, this provides information that has the potential to predict energy.</p>
