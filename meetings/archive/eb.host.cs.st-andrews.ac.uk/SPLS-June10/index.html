<h4>Jeremy Siek: 
Monads for Relations</h4>

<p>
  Monads provide a framework for writing modular and concise
  specifications for functions that appear to have computational
  effects. For example, an interpreter for a language with references
  can be written in Haskell as a function over a state monad. But what
  if we wish to define a relation, not a function?  Suppose we want to
  define a natural semantics for a language with references.  Natural
  semantics are inductively defined relations, not functions, so
  monads are not directly applicable.  But can we adapt monads to
  relations? The answer is yes; I show how in this talk.  I follow
  a similar structure to Wadler's ``The essence of functional
  programming,'' defining several extensions to the lambda calculus,
  but via natural semantics instead of interpreters.

<h4>Jon Lewis: Insense: a component-based language for self-configuring and
  self-healing wireless sensor network applications
</h4>

<p>
  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are complex, distributed systems
  whose components are commonly expected to operate in the face of
  unforeseen changes to the environment. WSN applications must be
  self-aware to be capable of adapting in response to such changes. We
  address this requirement with a high-level, component-based language
  model and implementation. In Insense, a sensing system is modelled
  as a composition of software components that interact via channels
  that may be published to the network and used to identify services
  available to other networked components. The language permits an
  application to dynamically discover both network topology and
  channels that have been published for inter-node
  use. Self-configuring application components are thereby able to
  search for the service channels they require and access these by
  configuring the channel bindings.  Self-healing is supported by an
  exception model permitting components to detect channel
  communication anomalies and through language mechanisms permitting
  applications to be dynamically reconfigured.

<h4>Seyed H Haeri: Observational Equivalence between Lazy Programs in
  Presence of Selective Strictness.
</h4>

<p>
Gabbay et al. were first to consider Observational Equivalence between
Lazy Programs in Presence of Selective Strictness and Haeri later
completed their work. Gabbay et al. and Haeri choose to manipulate the
operational semantics of van Eekelen and de Mol to prevent increase in
heap expressiveness upon expression evaluation. This improvement
helped them to prove their desired observational equivalences using a
novel proof technique called: Induction on the Number of Manipulated
Bindings (INMB). They used (INMB) to prove a handful of interesting
results including a couple of observational equivalences. However,
their operational semantics suffers from restrictions in
expressiveness.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, we investigate the elements in the operational semantics
of Gabbay et al. and Haeri which cause restrictions in
expressiveness. We present a new variation of van Eekelen and de Mol
that, in the same time that retains all the interesting results in
Gabbay et al. (including INMB), is as expressive as the operational
semantics of van Eekelen and de Mol.

<h4>Conor McBride: Jockstrapping Dependent Types</h4>

<p>
Tagless interpreters for well-typed terms in some object language
are a standard example of the power and beneﬁt of precise indexing
in types, whether with dependent types, or generalized algebraic
datatypes. The key is to reﬂect object language types as indices
(however they may be constituted) for the term datatype in the host
language, so that host type coincidence ensures object type coinci-
dence. Whilst this technique is widespread for simply typed object
languages, dependent types have proved a tougher nut with nontriv-
ial computation in type equality. In their type-safe representations,
Danielsson [2006] and Chapman [2009] succeed in capturing the
equality rules, but at the cost of representing equality derivations
explicitly within terms. This article delivers a type-safe represen-
tation for a dependently typed object language, dubbed KIPLING,
whose computational type equality just appropriates that of its host,
Agda. The KIPLING interpreter example is not merely de rigeur---
it is key to the construction. This is almost like bootstrapping,
but at a higher level.

<h4>Chris Brown: Ever-Decreasing Circles: a Skeleton for Parallel Orbit Calculations in Eden.</h4>

<p>
The Orbit algorithm is widely used in symbolic computation, allowing
the exploration of a solution space given some initial starting values
and a number of mathematically-defined generators.  In this paper, we
consider how the Orbit algorithm can be encoded in Haskell, and thence
how a parallel skeleton can be developed to cover a variety of Orbit
calculations, using the Eden parallel dialect of Haskell.  We report
on a set of performance results that demonstrate the potential of the
skeleton to allow a simple but effective implementation of the Orbit
algorithm for shared-memory parallel machines.
