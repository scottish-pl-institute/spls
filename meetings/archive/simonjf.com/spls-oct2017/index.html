<h3>12:00 - 13:00: Lunch</h3>

<h3>13:00 - 14:00: Concurrency Session The</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>13:00 - 13:30: Jan de Muijnck-Hughes -- Designing Hardware using Session Types and Dependent Types: A First Look</h4>
    <p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Border Patrol Project seeks to investigate how state-of-the-art advances in
programming language theory can provide better guarantees towards
System-On-Chip (SoC) design and execution.  Specifically we are interested in
extending existing work on structural type systems for SoC with that of
Multi-Party Session Types and Dependent Types.</p>

      <p>In this talk I will: briefly discuss the goals of the Border Patrol Project;
outline some of the design challenges we have encountered so far when looking
to adapt multi-party session types for describing hardware; and demonstrate how
dependent types help reason about the structure of SoC architectures.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>13:30 - 14:00: Thomas Weber -- Building useful UIs using Uselets</h4>
    <p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Whenever we want to write an application for real-world users, some form of UI
is required. But with something as unpredictable as a human on one side and a,
usually non-trivial, application on the other, things are bound to get
complicated. The fact that creating and updating UIs is often a
boilerplate-heavy process doesn't help, either.</p>

      <p>That makes UIs not a lot of fun to write, hard to understand, and cumbersome to
      maintain.</p>

      <p>Splitting the UI into smaller components, a popular approach, helps with the
      development of the individual components but adds additional wiring-overhead.</p>

      <p>We will take a look at how concurrency models can give us a high level
abstraction for easily composable UI components while allowing developers to
focus on the parts of a UI that really matter.</p>
    </blockquote></p>

<h3>14:00 - 14:30: Coffee</h3>

<h3>14:30 - 16:00: The Normali{s, z}ing Session</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>14:30 - 15:00: Stuart Gale -- Normalization or Bust</h4>
    <blockquote><p>
      This talk reports on the experiment of combining bidirectional
      typechecking with a small step operational semantics. Simply typed lambda
      calculus is, unsurprisingly, still normalizing. However, this is true
      even for terms that do not typecheck! The bidirectional setup marks each
      redex with its active type and reduction will get stuck if the type is
      insufficient.
    </p></blockquote>
  </li>

  <li><h4>15:00 - 15:30: Shayan Najd -- Embedding by Normalisation</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
 In this talk, I present the insight that the practical concept of embedded
 domain-specific compilers (EDSC), describing embedded domain-specific
 languages (EDSL) used for generating code often for external targets, is
 deeply related to the theoretical concept of Normalisation-By-Evaluation
 (NBE), describing the process of deriving the canonical form of terms with
 respect to an equational theory.
      </p>

      <p>
      Since an embedded term is encoded as a collection of host language terms,
evaluation of the non-value host terms results in normalisation of the embedded
term, and since EDSCs rely on an intermediate interface to generate their
target code from, all embedded terms are designed to eventually adhere to the
normal forms described by the interface. In other words, the structure of an
EDSC allows it to perform Normalisation on embedded terms By encoding them as a
collection of value and non-value host terms, employing Evaluation in the host
language, and then deriving the resulting terms adhering to the intermediate
interface. This structure, together with a collection of correctness laws,
forms an NBE process.
      </p>

      <p>
This connection, referred to as embedding by normalisation (EBN), is
theoretically useful in that it helps us to understand and reason about
embedded terms and their semantics, and practically beneficial in that it
enables us to directly apply techniques from NBE. For instance, through EBN, we
can adapt the treatment of sums, or constants, from NBE to embedding, resolving
some not fully resolved problems.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li><h4>15:30 - 16:00: James Chapman -- Delayed NBE</h4>
    <blockquote><p>
This talk is about normalization by evaluation for simply typed lambda
calculus using the delay monad. We use a novel coinductive approach to
proving termination of the algorithm that initially requires only
productivity. This allows the proofs of soundness and completeness
that would otherwise be dependent on termination to be independent. In
more complex situations where termination is difficult to prove or of
lower importance this is a useful technique.</p></blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>16:00 - 16:30: Coffee</h3>

<h3>16:30 - 18:00: The Parallel Session</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>16:30 - 17:00: Adam Barwell -- In Search of a Map</h4>
    <blockquote><p>
            Recursion schemes, such as the well-known map, can be used as loci of 
	    potential parallelism, where schemes are replaced with an 
	    equivalent parallel implementation. This talk describes a novel technique,
	    using program slicing, that automatically and statically identifies computations
	    in recursive functions that can be lifted out of the function and then potentially
	    performed in parallel. We have implemented our approach, and will report on our
	    results from applying our prototype to 12 Haskell examples, including benchmarks
	    from the NoFib suite and functions from the standard Haskell Prelude.
	    </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li><h4>17:00 - 17:30: Alastair Murray -- Layering Abstractions: Heterogeneous Programming and Performance Portability</h4>
    <blockquote><p>
      Widely used heterogeneous programming models such as OpenCL and CUDA
      provide programmers a means of exploiting heterogeneous hardware to
      achieve higher performance. A modern heterogeneous programming model,
      however, should also aid programmer productivity and allow for portable
      performance. This talk will give an overview of how this is being
      achieved by layering abstractions, by providing high-level domain
      specific approaches for programmers to model problems, and allowing the
      flexibility for even lower level layers to gain more precise control over
      hardware.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li><h4>17:30 - 18:00: Chris Schwaab -- First class Time and Energy for Multicore Systems</h4>
    <blockquote><p>
      Verifying non-functional properties of programs, such as time and/or
      energy consumption, is often a difficult task. With emerging applications
      such as the internet-of-things, however, it is becoming increasingly
      important that devices operate reliably within known time and energy
      bounds. At the same time, processor architectures are becoming more
      complex. This means that traditional, usually compositional, modeling
      techniques are not effective. To solve this problem, we propose the
      introduction of fuzzy bounds that will allow us to reason formally about
      the probabilistic consumption of resources, in terms of program inputs.
      Our approach is type-directed, relating program sources directly to their
      probabilistic costs.
