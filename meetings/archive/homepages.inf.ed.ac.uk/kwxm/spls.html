    <h1>Scottish Programming Languages Seminar</h1>
<h2>Friday 9th March 2007</h2>
<h3>Location</h3> 
 
<p> 
Conference Suite, School of Informatics,
   2 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9LW
</p> 

<p>
<b>Directions:</b> Enter at 2 Buccleuch Place,  climb the stairs to the first floor
(you may have to buzz to be let in at this point) and follow the signs.  
It's quite a long way to the Conference Suite,  which is in the basement of 4 Buccleuch Place.
</p>

<p>
Buccleuch Place is in central Edinburgh,  about 1km south of Waverley station.
<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=buccleuch+place+edinburgh&sll=53.098145,-2.443696&sspn=7.868755,15.292969&layer=&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=16&ll=55.943312,-3.186357&spn=0.007162,0.021973">Here</a>'s a link to Buccleuch Place on Google maps.  
The green arrow isn't pointing exactly at the venue: No. 2 is on the south 
side of the street, at the eastern end.
<br>
Parking a car may be tricky since the 
former car park near Appleton Tower is currently having the new Informatics
building built in it.  I'm told that there are usually parking spaces available
in Buccleuch Place and nearby streets,  but you may have to feed a meter every so often.
</p>

<h2>Rail strike</h2>
People coming to Friday's SPLS meeting from outwith Edinburgh should
be aware that rail services may be disrupted due to a strike of
railway signalling staff from noon on Wednesday 7th until noon on
Friday 9th.  See the <a href="http://www.firstgroup.com/scotrail/index.php">
First Scotrail website</a>
for more information.  They claim that there will be a half-hourly
service between Glasgow and Edinburgh,  but some other routes will
have no services at all.
