    <h1>Scottish Programming Languages Seminar</h1>

    <p>
    The next <a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/spls/">Scottish Programming Languages Seminar</a> will be held on
    <strong>Wednesday 30th October 2013</strong> at the
    <strong>Informatics Forum, University of Edinburgh</strong>. The
    organisers are <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/">Sam Lindley</a> and
    <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/staff/Roland_Perera.html">Roly Perera</a>.

    <p>
    The seminar will be held at the Informatics Forum, 10 Crichton
    Street, Edinburgh, EH8 9AB. A <a
    href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/maps/buildings/informatics-forum">map
    showing the Forum</a> is available. The entrance is opposite that of
    Appleton Tower.

    <p>
      Lunch will be available from 12.30pm, and talks will begin at
      1.30pm with an LFCS seminar delivered by SICSA distinguished
      visiting fellow <a href="http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~andygill/">Andy
      Gill</a>. The programme is below. We aim to finish at 5.30pm,
      after which we will head to a nearby pub.

    <p>
      Lunch and coffee breaks will be held in "Mini-Forum 2" (room
      4.40) - take the glass lift to the fourth floor and turn right;
      it is the large room at the end of the corridor. Talks will be
      held in room 4.31/4.33 - from the lift turn right, then right
      again into another corridor. The room is the glass-walled
      meeting room on the inside of the building. You can see it from
      the lift on the way up.

    <p>We will have signs directing you to both rooms on the day.

    <p>SPLS receives financial support from the Complex Systems Engineering theme of <a href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/">SICSA</a>,
       the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance. </p>

  </table>
  <div class="abstract">
  <p>The importance of reasoning about and refactoring programs
  is a central tenet of functional programming.
  Yet our compilers and development toolchains
  only provide rudimentary support for these tasks.
  To address this, we have implemented HERMIT, a toolkit enabling
  informal but systematic transformation of Haskell
  programs from inside the Glasgow Haskell Compiler's
  optimization pipeline.
  With HERMIT, users can experiment with optimizations
  and equational reasoning, while the
  tedious heavy lifting of performing the actual transformations
  is done for them.
  <p>HERMIT provides a transformation API that can be
  used to build higher-level rewrite tools.
  In this talk I will describe our principal HERMIT application---a
  read-eval-print shell for performing transformations using HERMIT.
  I will also demonstrate using this shell to prototype an optimization
  on a specific example, and discuss our experiences and remaining challenges.

     <td>Predictable Timing Behaviour on x86 Multicores using High-Level Patterns of Parallelism</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <div class="abstract">
  <p>The EU ParaPhrase Project is investigating new approaches to
  programming parallel computing systems using high-level patterns of
  parallelism to target heterogeneous parallel platforms.  In order to
  do this effectively, it is necessary to construct good timing models
  and analyses.

  <p>The relaxed-memory concurrency protocols that are enforced by commonly
  used hardware, such as x86 multicores and some ARM multicores, have
  complex functional and timing behaviours.  Understanding these
  behaviours is crucial to constructing good timing analyses for these
  architectures, that can be used to predict parallel performance.  This
  talk takes a principled and rigorous approach to relaxed memory
  concurrency, building on the functional and behavioural semantics of
  primitive x86 concurrency primitives including atomic memory
  exchanges, memory fences and a detailed cache model, to build accurate
  high-level timing analyses for some key high-level patterns of
  parallelism.  The talk shows that using these analyses, it is possible
  to accurately predict timing behaviour for real x86 multicores.

    <tr><th>Title:</th>  <td>From Parametricity to Conservation Laws, via Noether's Theorem</td></tr>
  </table>
  <div class="abstract">
  <p>Invariance is of paramount importance in programming languages and in
  physics. In programming languages, John Reynolds’ theory of relational
  parametricity demonstrates that parametric polymorphic programs are
  invariant under change of data representation, a property that yields
  “free” theorems about programs just from their types. In physics, Emmy
  Noether showed that if the action of a physical system is invariant
  under change of coordinates, then the physical system has a conserved
  quantity: a quantity that remains constant for all time. Knowledge of
  conserved quantities can reveal deep properties of physical systems.
  For example, the conservation of energy, which by Noether’s theorem is
  a consequence of a system’s invariance under time-shifting.

  <p>In this talk, I'll link Reynolds’ relational parametricity with
  Noether’s theorem for deriving conserved quantities. I propose an
  extension of System Fω with new kinds, types and term constants for
  writing programs that describe classical mechanical systems in terms
  of their Lagrangians. I'll show, by constructing a relationally
  parametric model of our extension of Fω, that relational parametricity
  is enough to satisfy the hypotheses of Noether’s theorem, and so to
  derive conserved quantities for free, directly from the polymorphic
  types of Lagrangians expressed in our system.

  </table>
  <div class="abstract">
  <p>In this talk I will present a type methodology combining linear types with 
  lightweight dependent types and how to use it in program analysis. 
  Linear types are useful for expressing properties of functions in terms of
  the usage of their input; lightweight dependent types are useful for
  describing the behavior of the program in terms of its control flow. 
  These two ideas fit together well when one is interested in
  analyzing properties of functions depending on the control flow of the
  program. I will present these ideas in the context of sensitivity analysis for 
  differential privacy.

  Without I/O, computation is mere mathematical whimsy, yet programming

  dump, we will survey the peculiar history of programming language I/O,
  deploying specious taxonomies to try and tease out and critique I/O
