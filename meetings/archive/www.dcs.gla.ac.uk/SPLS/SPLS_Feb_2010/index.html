          <em>Implementing Domain Specific Languages using Dependent Types and Partial Evaluation</em>
          <br><br>
            In this talk, I will describe the efficient implementation
            of domain specific languages (DSLs) in Idris, a
            dependently typed functional programming language. I will
            introduce the language Idris, and show how it can be used
            to implement a verified network transport protocol, as a
            DSL. I will present experimental evidence that partial
            evaluation of such programs yields efficient residual
            programs whose performance is competitive with their Java
            and C equivalents and which are also, through the use of
            dependent types, verifiably type- and resource-safe.

          <em>Amortised Resource Analysis with Separation Logic</em>
          <br><br>
            Type-based amortised resource analysis following Hofmann
            and Jost &mdash; where resources are associated with
            individual elements of data structures and doled out to
            the programmer under a linear typing discipline &mdash;
            have been successful in providing concrete resource bounds
            for functional programs, with good support for
            inference. In this work we translate the idea of amortised
            resource analysis to imperative languages by embedding a
            logic of resources, based on Bunched Implications, within
            Separation Logic. The Separation Logic component allows us
            to assert the presence and shape of mutable data
            structures on the heap, while the resource component
            allows us to state the resources associated with each
            member of the structure.
          <br><br>
            We present the logic on a small imperative language with
            procedures and mutable heap, based on Java bytecode. We
            have formalised the logic within the Coq proof assistant
            and extracted a certified verification condition
            generator. We demonstrate the logic on some examples,
            including proving termination of in-place list reversal on
            lists with cyclic tails.

          <em>Optimization of Tensor Based Languages</em>
          <br><br>
            The pervasiveness of matrix decompositions and tensor
            operations in knowledge representation, and the sciences:
            biological, chemical, physical, ... ([1, 2]) have renewed
            an interest in domain specific algorithms. Consequently,
            there also exists a renewed interest in domain specific
            computing: libraries (Flame), languages (Spiral),
            symbolic/numeric computing, expression templates,
            compilers, operating systems, and processor/memory
            hierarchies. The transformational nature of matrix (2-d
            tensors) operations and tensor operations in general,
            provides a prudent, hopeful, and deterministic way to
            reason about computation.  The determinism arises from the
            data structure, i.e. memory layout (contiguous), and the
            linear (and multilinear) operations applied to the data
            structure.  It also comes from using the same tensor
            operations to abstract the processor/memory/network
            hierarchy. This talk will discuss how to optimize multiple
            Kronecker Products using A Mathematics of Arrays and Psi
            Calculus, an algebra of multi-dimensional arrays and an
            index calculus.

          <em>The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the Database Dream</em>
          <br><br>
            A venerable line of research aims to provide a
            general-purpose programming language with a well-defined
            subset that compiles into efficient queries, perhaps by
            translation into SQL or some other suitable query
            language.  This talk discusses some older and more recent
            advances in this direction, including the languages
            Kleisli, LINQ, Ferry, M, and Links.

          <em>All Initial Algebras Support Induction</em>
          <br><br>
            We know that all initial algebras, solely from initiality,
            support recursive definitions. These are known as folds in
            the FP community.  But, so far, it seems that only certain
            classes of initial algebras support proof by
            induction. This is an asymmetry and it is displeasing.
          <br><br>
            I'll show how we can restore the harmony that the universe
            seeks. Namely, I'll show that all initial algebras, solely
            from their initiality, support proof by induction.
          <br><br>
            This is joint work with Patricia Johann.

          <em>A Simple Class Of Kripke-Style Models In Which Logic And Computation Have Equal Standing</em>
          <br><br>
            We present a sound and complete model of lambda-calculus
            reductions based on structures inspired by modal logic
            (closely related to Kripke structures).  Accordingly we
            can construct a logic which is sound and complete for the
            same models, and we identify lambda-terms with certain
            simple sentences (predicates) in this logic, by direct
            compositional translation. Under this identification,
            reduction becomes identified with logical entailment.
          <br><br>
            Thus, the models suggest a new way to identify logic and
            computation. Both have elementary and concrete
            representations in our models; where these representations
            overlap, they coincide.
          <br><br>
            In a concluding speculation, we note a certain subclass of
            the models which seems to play a role analogous to that
            played by the cumulative hierarchy models in axiomatic set
            theory and the natural numbers in formal arithmetic &mdash;
            there are many models of the respective theories, but only
            some, characterised by a fully second order
            interpretation, are the `intended' ones.
