                                In recent years, especially in the work of Benjamin Pierce and his coworkers on
                                lenses, the focus of the PL community has been on extensional, state-based
                                formalisms to describe bidirectional transformations (bx). More recently,
                                attention has turned to incorporating intensional information about edits (typically
                                based on monoid actions), or more generally, deltas (typically based on categories),
                                describing how models are updated.

                                Pervasive in both the conceptual modelling, and the mathematics, of varieties of
                                such bx, is the role played by the complement, which generalises the `constant
                                complement' case of the view-update problem in databases. Complements typically
                                reify, or correspond to, data which is abstracted away by passing from a source
                                to a view.

                                In this talk, I'll present an alternative perspective, which has perhaps been
                                implicit in the lens literature, but not, to our knowledge, previously made
                                explicit anywhere: namely that elements of the complement are witnesses to the
                                consistency relation maintained by the transformation. We illustrate this idea
                                with examples drawn from the bx literature, especially that on varieties of
                                lenses.

                                GAP is a dynamically typed language designed for discrete algebra, in particular
                                computational group theory. GAP has several unique features, most notably the
                                types of variables evolve during the execution of programs.

                                Recently a new project, known as HPC-GAP, is working on moving GAP into a

                                continue to function with no changes, and be parallelised with minimal changes.
                                This revealed that GAP's current testing framework is insufficient.

                                Contemporary GPU architectures are heavily biased towards the execution of

                                are based around data structures which are naturally sparse and irregular. This
                                makes efficiently parallelising and executing sparse applications on GPUs
                                difficult, as programmers must resort to low level, domain specific
                                optimisations which are often non-portable, and difficult to express in current

                                parallel operations. As part of this, I'll discuss how we implemented a specific
                                sparse structure and algorithm within a regular pattern based programming
                                framework, the correlations we found between good implementation choices and
                                input irregularity and some promising preliminary performance results.

                                Programs have two conflicting roles. In a single artefact, the

                                how the hardware resources must be marshalled to accomplish this task. 
                                As a gross generalisation, functional languages are well-suited to the 
                                former, while imperative languages excel at explicit control of resources.

                                extended with features for array programming.
