<H3>Lunch and Dinner</H3>

<P> Some members of the Mathematically Structured Programming group
will be going for lunch before and dinner after the meeting. Lunch
will likely be on campus, and dinner will likely be at a nearby North
Indian restaurant. If you would like to join us for either, please
contact <A href="http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~patricia/">Patricia Johann</A> ahead of time so that she can make appropriate
arrangements. This is especially important for dinner, since she'll need
to make a reservation on a Friday night.  </P>

<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
The meeting will be held in Room 13.18 on the 13th floor of
Livingstone Tower, located in Richmond Street, Glasgow. <A
href="http://www.strath.ac.uk/maps/livingstonetower/">This map</A>
shows the location of Livingstone Tower relative to Queen Street train
station.
</P>

<P>
For those coming into Glasgow Central train station, it is possible to
take the underground from St Enoch to Buchanan Street, which is close to Queen Street station. It is easier to walk.
</P>

<P>
To get to Livingstone Tower from Queen Street station, walk east along
George Street a few blocks to Montrose. That is, if you are at Queen
Street station facing George Park, then walk along the street to your
left. Turn left at Montrose and go up a fairly steep hill about half a
block. Turn right onto Richmond. Livingstone Tower is almost all the
way to the end of the first block of Richmond, on the right-hand side
of the street.
</P>

<P>
Once at Livingstone Tower, enter and go up a few stairs, then a short
distance ahead turn and go up another few stairs (or the ramp) to your
left. Go through the doors into an elevator alcove. Take an elevator
to the 13th floor, and find Room 13.18. It is at one end of the floor,
so shouldn't be hard to find. The CS main office is on the 10th floor
and my office is 12.17, in case that's helpful to know.
</P>

<P>
If you are driving to the meeting and need directions or information
about parking, please email <A href="http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~patricia/">Patricia Johann</A>.
