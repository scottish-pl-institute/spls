<B>14.00</B> <B>Totality versus Turing Completeness</B><BR>
Conor McBride, University of Strathclyde<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's a well known fact that a total programming language
   can't encode its own interpreter. Some advocates and most
   detractors of total programming note that it comes at the
   cost of Turing Completeness, another well known fact.
   These well known facts are about as true as the fact that
   "Haskell can't handle I/O." I shall talk about ways in
   which total languages can model the risk of nontermination,
   and show you a method I have found useful, inspired by
   notions of algebraic effect.

<B>14.45</B> <B>Experiments in standard library design with Plaid</B><BR>
Iain McGinniss, University of Glasgow<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Plaid is an object-functional, optionally typed dynamic language with
deeply integrated typestate features, developed by Jonathan Aldrich
et. al at Carnegie Mellon University. This novel combination of
language features offers an interesting research opportunity to
explore the design space of a standard library. Standard libraries in
modern languages are expected to include robust and efficient data
structures and IO abstractions (amongst many other things), provided
in an idiomatic manner, exploiting the full set of features of the
language. This talk will give a brief introduction to Plaid, and
outline the design considerations made in the implementation of
Plaid's current standard library.

<B>16.00</B> <B>Handlers in Action</B><BR>
Ohad Kammar, University of Edinburgh<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We present a small-step operational semantics for a simplified
Call-by-Push-Value variant of Bauer and Pretnar's Eff programming
language.  Eff incorporates functional and imperative features by
adapting Plotkin and Pretnar's effect handlers as a programming
paradigm.

This is preliminary work with Sam Lindley and Nicolas Oury.

<B>16.45</B> <B>Linear Types in Programming Languages: Progress and Prospects</B><BR>
Simon Gay, University of Glasgow<BR>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The publication of Girard's original paper on linear logic, in 1987,
provoked immediate interest in developing linear type systems by
applying the Curry-Howard isomorphism. So why has linear typing not
appeared as a standard feature of mainstream programming languages, in
the way that parametric polymorphism has?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this talk I will explore this theme, commenting on past, present
and future uses of linear types in programming languages.
