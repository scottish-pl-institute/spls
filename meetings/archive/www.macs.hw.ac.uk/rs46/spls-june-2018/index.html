<h2>Talks</h2>

    <li><B>12:00 - Lunch</B><br><br>

    <li><B>12:30 - Multi-level parallelism for high performance
    combinatorics</B><br><i>Florent Hivert, University

      <div id="abstract">
	In this talk, I will report on several experiments around
	large scale enumerations in enumerative and algebraic
	combinatorics.
	<br>
        I'll describe a methodology used to achieve large speedups in
        several enumeration problems. Indeed, in many combinatorial
        structures (permutations, partitions, monomials, young
        tableaux), the data can be encoded as a small sequence of
        small integers that can often efficiently be handled by a
        creative use of processor vector instructions. Through the
        challenging example of numerical monoids, I will then report
        on how Cilkplus allows for a extremely fast parallelization of
        the enumeration. Indeed, we have been able to enumerate sets
        with more that 10^15 elements on a single multicore machine.

    <li><B>13:00 - AnyDSL: Building Domain-Specific Languages for
	Productivity and Performance</B><br><i>Roland Leißa, Saarland
	University</i><br><br>

      <div id="abstract">
	Nowadays, the computing landscape is becoming increasingly
	heterogeneous and this trend is currently showing no signs of
	turning around. In particular, hardware becomes more and more
	specialized and exhibits different forms of parallelism. For
	performance-critical codes it is indispensable to address
	hardware-specific peculiarities. Because of the halting
	problem, however, it is unrealistic to assume that a program
	implemented in a general-purpose programming language can be
	fully automatically compiled to such specialized hardware
	while still delivering peak performance.<br>

	In this talk, we present AnyDSL. This framework allows to
	embed a so-called domain-specific language (DSL) into a host
	language. On the one hand, a DSL offers the application
	developer a convenient interface; on the other hand, a DSL can
	perform domain-specific optimizations and effectively map DSL
	constructs to various architectures. In order to implement a
	DSL, one usually has to write or modify a compiler. With
	AnyDSL though, the DSL constructs are directly implemented in
	the host language while a partial evaluator removes any
	abstractions that are required in the implementation of the
	DSL.

    <li><B>13:30 - Taking Linear Logic Apart<br></B><i>Wen Kokke,
    University of Edinburgh</i><br><br>

      <div id="abstract">
      Process calculi based in logic, such as πDILL and CP, provide a
      foundation for deadlock-free concurrent programming. However, in
      previous work, there has been a mismatch between the rules for
      constructing proofsand the term constructors of the
      π-calculus. We introduce the Hypersequent Classical Processes
      (HCP),which addresses this mismatch by using hypersequents
      (collections of sequents) to register parallelism inthe typing
      judgements. We prove that HCP enjoys deadlock-freedom and a
      series of properties that relate it back to CP.

    <li><B>14:30 - The Syntax and Semantics of Quantitative Type
    Theory<br></B><i>Bob Atkey, University of Strathclyde</i>.<br><br>

      <div id="abstract">
      I will talk about Quantitative Type Theory, a Type Theory that
      records usage information for each variable, refining a system by
      McBride. The additional usage information means that it is possible to
      assign a computational meaning to each term of the theory that is
      appropriately "resource sensitive". Practically, this means that we
      can compile type theory to environments where resources are
      scarce. Formally, it is a realisability semantics over a variant of
      Linear Combinatory Algebras. The semantics is defined in terms of
      Quantitative Categories with Families, a novel extension of Categories
      with Families for modelling resource sensitive type theories.

    <li><B>15:00 - Proof-relevant Horn Clauses for Dependent Type
Inference and Term Synthesis</B><br><i>Franta Farka, Heriot-Watt
University</i><br><br>

      <div id="abstract">
	First-order resolution has been used for type inference for
	many years, including in Hindley- Milner type inference,
	type-classes, and constrained data types. Dependent types are
	a new trend in functional languages. In this paper, we show
	that proof-relevant first-order resolution can play an
	important role in automating type inference and term synthesis
	for dependently typed languages. We propose a calculus that
	translates type inference and term synthesis problems in a
	dependently typed language to a logic program and a goal in
	the proof-relevant first-order Horn clause logic. The computed
	answer substitution and proof term then provide a solution to
	the given type inference and term synthesis problem.

          <li><B>15:30 - Python Dynamic Source Fuzzing using
    Aspects</B><br><i>Tom Wallis, University of Glasgow</i><br><br>

      <div id="abstract">
	Aspect oriented programming is an interesting paradigm which
	allows a separation of cross-cutting concerns from a problem
	domain. Standard examples of cross-cutting concerns are things
	like logging or debugging code, which can be separated out
	from core programming logic. We produce an aspect orientation
	library — “ASP” — for Python 2, and demonstrate the mechanisms
	which help it to work — and then demonstrate that variance can
	be treated as a cross-cutting concern, where alterations to
	processes can be applied using aspects. We demonstrate that,
	using ASP’s mechanisms, process fuzzing libraries can be built
	which apply random process mutation as a cross-cutting
	concern. We show that this can be used for accurate modelling
	of socio-technical behaviour, and then demonstrate some more
	advanced process fuzzing aspects which can be used for the
	implementation of things like genetic programming.

    <li><B>16:30 - Announcement</B><br><i>Jeremy Singer, University
    of Glasgow</i><br><br>
      
    <li><B>16:35 - The language of stratified sets, Quine’s NF,
rewriting, and higher-order logic: A brief tour</B><br><i>Jamie
Gabbay, Heriot-Watt University</i><br><br>

      <div id="abstract">

	Russell's paradox is a famous inconsistency in naive set
        theory, that there is a set R such that R is a member of
        itself if and only if it is not a member of itself.  Three
        solutions to this problem are: ZF set theory, higher-order
        logic, and Quine's NF.
	<br>
	I will motivate and describe Quine's NF, which is a simple
	system to define and which depends on a beautiful and
	mysterious "stratification condition".  I will give an
	accessible account of this stratification condition, embed it
	into higher-order logic to help make sense of it, and then
	approach NF from the point of view of term-rewriting to note
	that it has some nice properties.

	The language of Stratified Sets is confluent and strongly normalising.

The <B>34 bus</B> enters the campus via the research park. Get off at
the stop indicated at the red mark above. Alternative bus services are
the <B>25</B> and <B>45</B> (see below).

<br><br>

SPLS is happening in G.01 (ground floor) of the postgraduate building,
which looks like this:<br>

<img src="https://www.rias.org.uk/images/image-popover/2013/02/05/A7837607-A11D-7B01-21DB-2A16BC8AF7BC.jpg"/>

<h4>By bus</h4>

Heriot-Watt is served by numerous buses.  25, 34 and 45 serve the
route between the city centre and the university, with the 25 passing
Haymarket Station and all three stopping near Waverley station. The
cost is £1.70 per trip, and you need to have the exact fare.
<br><br>
<li> <B>34 route</B> get off at the penultimate stop on campus. The
Post Graduate building is opposite the Earl Mountbatten (Computer
Science) building.
<li><B>45 route</B> get off at the penultimate stop on campus (same
as <B>34</B>).
<li><B>25 route</B> get off on the final stop and enjoy the walk over
The Loch.
<br>

<h4>By train</h4>

The closest stations to Heriot-Watt are <B>Curriehill</B> (where some
trains to/from Glasgow Central stop), <B>Edinburgh Park</B> (where
trains to/from the west, including some Glasgow trains, and Stirling
trains stop) and <B>Edinburgh Gateway</B> (where trains to/from the
north, including Aberdeen, Inverness and Perth trains stop).  There is
no public transport from any of these stations to the university, so
you will need to take a taxi (5-10 minute journey) from the station.
You may be able to pick one up at the station, but it is advisable to
book one in advance.
<br>
If your train doesn’t stop at any of these stations, you can get off
at <B>Haymarket</B> and take the 25 bus from there.  If you are coming
from the south, you can get the 25, 34 or 45 from
near <B>Waverley</B>.

<h3>Social</h3>

The upstairs area in the Haymarket Pub has been booked from 18:15. The
pub is opposite the Haymarket train station, easy for onwards rail
travellers.

<br><br>
It's easier to get there using the <B>25</B> bus service. To get to a
bus top for the 25 from the Postgraduate centre:

<br><br>
There is a stop very close to the Haymarket pub.
<br><br>

Alternatively, if you wish to use the <B>34</B> bus service, then the
Haymarket pub is a short walk:
