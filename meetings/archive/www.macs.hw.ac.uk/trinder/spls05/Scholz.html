<h1>Using Subtypes and Intersection Types to Strike the Balance Between Static and Dynamic Typing</h1>

<h2>Dr Sven-Bodo Scholz, Unievrsity of Hertfordshire</h2>

<p>
In array programming, the most common domain error encountered is
out-of-bound selection.  Unfortunately these errors cannot be statically
detected unless either the source language is substantially restricted
or the type system is rendered undecidable.
</p><p>
In the context of Single Assignment C ( or SaC for short) we have
developed a hybrid approach.  We do not restrict the source language
but introduce runtime checks in those situation where we statically
cannot decide whether they are free of domain errors or not. This is
achieved by introducing a hierarchy of array types and a form of
intersection types which allow the level of static type inference
to be adjusted dynamically.
</p><p>
For many programs this approach detects all domain inconsistencies
statically.  However, in those situations where such a statical analysis
is not feasible a less precise approximation can be made deferring some
of the domain checks to runtime.  This comes for the price of a type
inference which is unique modulo subtyping only, but allows all potentially
correct programs to be compiled and run.
