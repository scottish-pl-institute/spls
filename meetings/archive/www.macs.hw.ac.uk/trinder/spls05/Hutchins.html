    <h1>Feature Oriented Programming</h1>

<h2>DeLesley Hutchins, Edinburgh University</h2>

Feature-oriented programming is a mechanism for program composition
which is similar to aspect-oriented programming and multi-dimensional 
separation of concerns.  A feature is a high-level unit of program 
behavior.  Typically, features cannot be encapsulated within a single 
function or class; instead, they cross-cut the implementation of many 
functions and classes throughout the source code.
<p>
In this talk, I will give a brief introduction to features, and discuss 
why they are useful, and how they are related to other approaches.  I 
will then introduce a simple "feature calculus".  Current 
implementations of features have no formal semantics.  They are layered 
on top of Java or C++, and are implemented by means of source code 
transformation.  In my calculus, feature composition is treated as a 
form of type intersection over self-recursive records.  I believe that 
this is a particularly elegant way of thinking about features, and one 
which clearly shows how they fit in to the larger realm of progamming 
languages in general.
