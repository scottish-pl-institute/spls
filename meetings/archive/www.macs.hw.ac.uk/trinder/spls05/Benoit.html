    <h1>Enhancing the performance of Grid Applications with Skeletons
and Process Algebras</h1>

<h2>Dr Anne Benoit, Edinburgh University</h2>

In a context of Grid programming, a skeleton-based approach recognises
that many real applications draw from a range of well-known solution
paradigms and seeks to make it easy for an application developer to
tailor such a paradigm to a specific problem. Powerful structuring
concepts are presented to the application programmer as a library of
pre-defined "skeletons".
<p>
In the eSkel project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060709053758/http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abenoit1/eSkel">Edinburgh Skeleton
Library</a>, motivated by our observations on previous attempts to
implement these ideas, we have begun to define a generic set of
skeletons as a library of C functions on top of MPI. The first part of
the talk will focus on the library eSkel, presenting the main
fundamental concepts which form the basis of the library.
</p><p>
The use of a particular skeleton of the eSkel library carries with it
considerable information about implied scheduling dependencies. I will
present in the second part of the talk how we exploit these
information in the Enhance project (http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/enhance),
by modelling these skeletons with stochastic process algebras
(PEPA). This modelling process is automated, and since grid technology
provides facilities for dynamic monitoring of resource performance,
our approach supports adaptive rescheduling of applications.
