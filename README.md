# Scottish Programming Languages Seminar Series

The Scottish Programming Languages Seminar (SPLS) is a forum for discussion of all aspects of programming languages.
We meet for a day or afternoon once every few months, at some congenial location in Scotland.
Talks by Scots and by visitors are welcome.
Please contact us if you would like to host a meeting or give a talk.

Meetings are open, and all are welcome to attend.
If you are travelling far or if you do not subscribe to the mailing list, you are advised to contact the organiser to check that there have been no last-minute changes.

## Email List


The email list is used to announce SPLS meetings, and occasionally for conference announcements, job adverts and other PL-related discussion.

To subscribe, send an email to `sympa@lists.cent.gla.ac.uk` with the following in the Subject line:

```
SUB spls  NAME
```

where NAME is your first name followed by your last name.

To unsubscribe, send an email to `sympa@lists.cent.gla.ac.uk` with nothing in the Subject line.
In the message body put the following:

```

where `EMAIL` is an optional email address, useful if different from your "From:" address.
If you normally have an automatic signature at the end of your email, please put the word `QUIT` just before your signature.
