# Scottish Programming Languages Seminar Series

The Scottish Programming Languages Seminar (SPLS) is a forum for
discussion of all aspects of programming languages. We meet for a day
or afternoon once every few months, at some congenial location in
Scotland. Talks by Scots and by visitors are welcome. Please contact
us if you would like to host a meeting or give a talk.
