  <h1>Scottish Programming Languages Seminar</h1>
  <p>The Scottish Programming Languages Seminar is a forum for
  discussion of all aspects of programming languages. We meet for a
  day or afternoon once every few months, at some congenial
  location in Scotland. Talks by Scots and by visitors are welcome.
  Please contact us if you would like to host a meeting or give a
  talk.</p>
  <p>Meetings are open, and all are welcome to attend. If you are
  travelling far or if you do not subscribe to the mailing list,
  you are advised to contact the organiser to check that there have
    been no last-minute changes.</p>
  <h2>Email List</h2>

    for conference announcements, job adverts and other PL-related
    discussion.
